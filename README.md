Imaging system for autonomous marine vessels

This project is an exmaple of a system which intend to fuse data from few sensors, in this case a real sense 3D data with data from two thermal cameras in stereo-vision mode, and incorporate machine/deep learning algorithms for obstacle detection & tracking.
All the experiments done in a more availble environment and much more work still to be done in testing on real environment, as from the point of view of algorithms imporvements. 

For more details see the report.
